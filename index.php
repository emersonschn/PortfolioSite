    Hi! My name is Emerson Schnipke and I am studying Computer Science and Engineering at 
    The Ohio State University. I am very passionate about programming and have been 
    doing it since grade school. I also enjoy reading, camping, and playing guitar in my free
    time. <br> <br>  Keep up with all of my most recent 
    projects and experiences on my blog and GitHub! For any business inquiries or project collaboration 
    requests, feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn.
